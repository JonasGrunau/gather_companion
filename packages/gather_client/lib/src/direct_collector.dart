/// on the bridge being reachable at all.
///
/// ## Entering, and what it costs
///
/// `loadSpaceUser` materialises our SpaceUser and starts the state dump.
/// `enterSpace` is a *separate* action, and it is what actually puts an avatar in
/// the room. **This collector sends it**, because the app is no longer only
/// watching: a phone that publishes audio and video is a participant, and a
/// participant is present. `Connection.entered` goes true, and `reportActivity`
/// follows so we do not sit there looking idle to colleagues.
///
/// The bridge's copy of this collector (`bridge/lib/direct.js`) does **not** enter
/// and must never start. It exists to wake a sleeping phone and has no reason to
/// be in a room. That divergence is deliberate — see `AGENTS.md` — and is the one
/// place these two implementations of the same wire format are allowed to differ.
///
/// Two connections of your own do not fight: `Connection` is per-connection but
/// `SpaceUser` is per-person-per-space, so the desktop client and this one drive
/// the same avatar. Measured 2026-08-06: neither an observer connection nor an
/// entered one disturbed the desktop client's socket, `enterSpace` returned
/// `{type:'Success'}`, and our position was unchanged either side of it.
///
/// What entering costs is real and worth knowing: **`numTimesEnteredSpace`
/// increments per entering connection**, and it is a permanent counter on the
/// user's own profile. That makes reconnect frequency a thing with a price, which
/// is why `AppState.verifyLink()` does not reconnect a socket that is already
/// healthy. Do not "simplify" that into an unconditional resync.
///
/// ## No resync
///
/// The full state dump is sent once per *connection*. So there is nothing to ask
/// for: [resync] reconnects, and the dump follows immediately. On a phone this is
/// the behaviour that matters most — iOS suspends the app, the socket dies
/// unannounced, and on resume a fresh connection is both the repair and the
/// refresh.
