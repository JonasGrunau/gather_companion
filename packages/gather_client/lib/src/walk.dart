/// Driving your own avatar from the phone, one tile at a time.
///
/// The `move` action is the whole of Gather's movement API — `{direction}`, one tile
/// per call — and its body on the model is three lines with no check in it:
///
/// ```js
/// const e = new Direction(A.direction).toPositionDelta();
/// const g = new Position({x: this.x + e.x, y: this.y + e.y});
/// this.direction = new Direction(A.direction);
/// this.setPosition(g, {map: ..., prevPosition: this.position})
/// ```
///
/// So everything that makes movement feel like movement lives on the client, and this
/// is that half of it. Two problems, and they are the whole file.
///
/// ## Knowing where you are
///
/// Whether a step is legal depends on the tile you are standing on, and this cannot
/// read that off the roster: positions arrive coalesced over 250ms while a walk runs
/// at seven tiles a second, so by the time Gather confirms the tile you are on, you
/// asked to leave it two steps ago. Checking collision against a stale tile means
/// walking into the first wall you meet.
///
/// So the tile is tracked here, and the roster corrects it rather than supplying it —
/// the same optimism the client applies (`optimistic: true` on the action itself).
/// [noteRoster] keeps every tile stepped onto and not yet seen confirmed, and treats
/// an arriving position three ways:
///
///  * **it is one we claimed** — the steps up to it have landed; drop them and keep
///    believing the rest, which are still in flight.
///  * **it is the one we are standing on** — the same case; the list empties.
///  * **it is somewhere we never claimed to be** — a step was dropped, or the desktop
///    client moved, or party mode hopped. Gather is right and this is wrong.
///
/// That last branch is what makes a phone D-pad safe to share an avatar with a laptop.
///
/// ## Not walking through the office
///
/// [SpaceMap.canStep] is the rule and it is transcribed rather than invented; see
/// `space_map.dart`. This applies it before every step and simply declines the ones
/// that fail. A refused step is not an error worth showing — it is a wall — so it
/// stops the avatar and nothing else.
///
/// **No map, no walking.** A step sent without one is a step nobody checked, and the
/// consequence is not a glitch: the office footprint is 96×52 of a 124×82 grid, and
/// the emptiness around it is walkable as far as the game server is concerned.
