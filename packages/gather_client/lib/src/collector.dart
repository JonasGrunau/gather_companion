///
/// This exists for the same reason [Call] does. The presence plane is a socket a
/// test runner — or a simulator with no network — has no way to reach, and the
/// whole app reads off it: the roster, the map, the activity bus, who is talking,
/// where everyone is standing. `AppState` holds one of these, and `Walk` and
/// `PartyMode` reach the same object through a closure, so a fake that implements
/// this interface makes the office walkable, party mode runnable and the feed
/// alive with no server behind any of it — see `lib/harness/fake_collector.dart`.
///
/// [DirectCollector] is the real one, a WebSocket to Gather's game router. Every
/// member here is one the app already calls on it; this is that surface, named,
/// not a new capability. The compiler keeps the two in step —
/// `DirectCollector implements Collector`.
