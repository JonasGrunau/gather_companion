/// Talking to Gather's media plane.
///
/// The game socket carries presence. Media is a **separate protocol on separate
/// sockets**: Socket.IO rather than msgpack, at
/// `wss://router.v2.gather.town` for SFU assignment and at a per-node
/// `wss://sfu-v2.<region>.prod.aws.gather.town/ip-<addr>` for the media itself.
/// Captured off the desktop client 2026-08-13 with `tool/probe-sfu.mjs`; the
/// message tables are in `docs/gather-api.md`.
///
/// This class is the transport and nothing more. It knows how to authenticate,
/// how to ask a question and match the answer, and how to hand on the things the
/// server says unprompted. It does not know what a producer is. That keeps the
/// reverse-engineered half — the half most likely to be wrong — in a package
/// `dart test` can exercise in seconds with no device and no camera.
///
/// ## Three things that are not guesses
///
/// **Auth is the Socket.IO CONNECT packet.** `{spaceId, token}`, where `token` is
/// the same Firebase ID token the game socket uses. Not a header, not a query
/// parameter, and there is no separate "video token" to fetch — which is why
/// [GatherAuth] is enough to get in.
///
/// **The correlation key is the Socket.IO ack id.** Gather's `sendWithResponse`
/// is not a bespoke mechanism layered on a socket; it is `emit(name, args, cb)`.
/// So [sendWithResponse] is a thin wrapper over `emitWithAck` rather than the
/// hand-rolled pending-completer map the game socket would have needed — and
/// specifically **not** `emitWithAckAsync`, for the reason spelled out at the call
/// itself: half of Gather's methods answer with an empty array, which that method
/// cannot survive.
///
/// **Most calls carry a sequence number, but not all.** The envelope is
/// `{wsSequenceNumber, zodData}` — except for [_bareMethods], which send their
/// arguments unwrapped. Wrapping an exempt call, or failing to wrap a normal one,
/// is the kind of mistake Gather answers with silence rather than an error.
///
/// ## Reconnection is ours, not the library's
///
/// `reconnection` is disabled deliberately, mirroring the desktop client. An ID
/// token lives about an hour, so a socket that silently reconnected would
/// eventually re-present a dead credential and fail in a way that looks like a
/// network fault. Every connection here mints a fresh token first.

/// and both halves after the host are traps:
///
///  * **The `/ip-…` segment is a path prefix, not a namespace.** Handed to
///    `socket_io_client` whole, it is read as the Socket.IO *namespace* and the
///    request goes to `/socket.io/` at the root — which the node answers with a
///    plain HTTP response, so the upgrade never happens. The desktop client
///    connects to `/ip-10-206-194-73/socket.io/`, measured; the prefix belongs in
///    the `path` option.
///  * **`wss://` with an explicit `:443` yields port 0.** `socket_io_client`
