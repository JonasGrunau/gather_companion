/// The things you can do about yourself, gathered into one island over the floor.
///
/// Gather's own client puts these across the bottom of the office — who you are,
/// whether you are available, your microphone, your camera, and a row of
/// reactions — and that is the right place for them, because they are all
/// answers to "what am I doing in this room" rather than places to go. The rail
/// underneath is navigation; this is participation, and keeping the two as
/// separate islands is what stops a person hunting for the mute button among the
/// tabs.
///
/// ## What is here, and what is deliberately not
///
/// Gather's bar also carries a screen-share button. It does not survive the trip
/// to a phone: there is nothing on a phone worth sharing a window of.
///
/// Gather's door does survive, and it is **one** door, as it is on the desktop.
/// This bar briefly had three ways out — a desk button, a *leave* button beside it
/// while you were in a conversation, and a third meaning for that leave button on
/// the call screen — and three buttons for one intention is two too many. There is
/// one door now, [_doorButton], drawn with the `logout` glyph — a door with the
/// way out marked on it — and what it does depends on
/// where you are: in a conversation it leaves it and walks you home; away from
/// your desk it walks you home; at your desk with nobody around it is dim, because
/// you are already where the door leads. It never leaves the *space*: the socket
/// this app holds **is** the presence everything else in it reports, so a door out
/// of the space would switch the product off.
///
/// The two chevrons beside Gather's microphone and camera open device pickers.
/// A phone has one microphone and two cameras, and the second is a button rather
/// than a menu, so those are gone too.
///
/// ## What red means, and the one control that is dimmed
///
/// Red used to be the mute state: a crossed-out microphone painted in
/// [GatherTokens.danger]. It is not any more, because the glyph had already said
/// it. `mic_off` *is* a microphone with a line through it — the shape carries the
/// state — and painting it red as well spent the bar's one alarming colour on the
/// most ordinary thing a person does in a meeting. Off is now the same grey every
/// other resting icon is, and [GatherTokens.brand] marks the two controls that are
/// actually broadcasting.
///
/// Red is spent instead on the door, where it says something no glyph can: there
/// is somewhere you are not — you are in a conversation, or you are not where the
/// office has you filed. The D-pad's rule — pressed is a step of opacity, never a
/// different paint — is about a control being *pushed*, and still holds for the
/// press itself.
///
/// The door is also the one control here that is ever greyed out, against the
/// standing rule that a button which can do nothing is absent rather than dimmed.
/// The rule is right for the others: the camera flip appears when there is a
/// camera to flip and is gone when there is not, and its absence costs the reader
/// nothing. Being at your own desk is different. It is the answer to "where am I",
/// it is the state a person opens the bar to check, and a button that has vanished
/// cannot tell anybody they have arrived. So the door is absent only when Gather
/// has given you no desk *and* there is no conversation to leave, and dim when you
/// are already sitting at your desk with nobody around you.

/// The eight reactions, as the dock's top row.

/// Undecorated: the dock paints the island, and a second bordered box inside it
/// would read as a dialog sitting on a bar rather than as the bar having grown a
/// row.
///
/// ## Why the eight divide the width instead of setting it
///
/// The whole dock is sized by an [IntrinsicWidth] over its rows, so anything with
/// an opinion about its own width can move the island. Eight 40-point reactions
/// have a very firm one — 328 points, eight past the [kRailMinWidth] floor the two
/// permanent rows settle on — and the island grew by those eight points every time
/// the tray opened and shrank back every time a reaction was picked. Nothing was
/// wrong with the tray; the dock was being asked a question by a row that is only
/// up for a second.
///
/// So the tray answers zero when asked how wide it wants to be ([_NoWidthOpinion])
/// and divides whatever it is handed between the eight ([Expanded]). The closed
/// tray already worked this way by accident: a childless `SizedBox(width:
/// double.infinity)` reports an intrinsic width of zero, which is exactly the
/// "fill it, don't set it" this needed all along.
