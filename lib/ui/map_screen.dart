/// This exists because the map turned out to be free. Gather never serves it over
/// REST, but every state dump carries it in full — rooms, furniture and the
/// collision shapes behind them — and this client used to discard all of it.
///
/// It used to stop there, at blocks of colour, on the reasoning that 124 tiles
/// across a phone is three pixels a tile and anything more detailed is a smudge.
/// That was right about the zoomed-out view and wrong about the screen: the map is
/// pannable, and once you are close enough to read a room name you are close enough
/// to want the desks in it. So the schematic is still here, underneath, and the real
/// art is drawn over it as it arrives.
///

/// one image per floor texture, wall piece and furniture variant, and so does
/// [SpaceArt]. On the space this was built against that is 573 images totalling
/// 222 KB, which is why "draw all of it" is a reasonable thing to do on a phone. See
