/// room, but a menu is a bad place for anything you might want to *read* — it
/// closes when you look away, and it can only hold verbs. The state that
/// actually matters here is nouns: whether Gather is connected, which space you
/// are in, which computer is paired, whether that computer can still wake the
/// app for a notification. None of that fitted in a menu, so none of it was
/// shown anywhere.
///
/// Nothing on this screen is a preference. The two real preferences the app has
/// — `Notifier.notifyOnFollow` and `Notifier.notifyOnGather` — are deliberately
/// absent, because they are plain fields with no persistence behind them: a
/// switch wired to one would forget itself on the next launch, which is worse
