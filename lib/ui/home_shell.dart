/// The three places the app is, and the rail that moves between them.
///
/// Before this there was no navigation: the whole paired app was the feed, and
/// everything else hung off icons crammed into its header — a map button, a
/// refresh button, and an overflow menu holding the device check and unpairing.
/// The map was the thing worth opening the app for and it was the thing hidden
/// behind an unlabelled glyph.
///
/// ## Why the office is kept alive rather than rebuilt
///
/// The obvious shape — swap the body when the tab changes — is wrong here, and
/// expensively so. `MapScreen` owns an `ArtCache` holding 573 decoded images for
/// the reference space, a `TransformationController` holding where you have
/// panned to, and a `_placed` flag that fires the "centre on me at 3×" opening
/// shot exactly once. Destroying that subtree on every tab switch re-decodes the
/// floor from disk and yanks the view back to the opening shot, which makes the
/// rail feel like it is reloading the office rather than returning to it. So all
/// three tabs live in an `IndexedStack` and keep their state.
///
/// That has two costs, and both are paid here rather than left to leak:
///
///  * **Tickers keep running when nothing is on screen.** `MapMotion` drives the
///    walk at 60fps and does not know it is behind another tab. Each tab is
///    wrapped in a `TickerMode` so the ones you are not looking at are muted.
///  * **`AppState.positions` ticks at 4Hz.** That listenable exists precisely so
///    that footsteps repaint the map without waking the rest of the tree, so
///    merging it in unconditionally would hand the map four rebuilds a second
///    while you are reading settings. It is merged in only while the map is the
///    selected tab.
///
/// ## Why the rail floats
///
/// The map body is deliberately not wrapped in a `SafeArea` — the floor runs
/// under the home indicator, because that is what fullscreen has to mean for
/// something you pan around. A docked bar would cut a strip off the bottom of
/// the office to sit in. Instead the rail is an island over the floor, and the
/// shell adds its height to the bottom of every tab's `MediaQuery` padding. Each
/// tab's existing `SafeArea(top: false)` then clears the rail without knowing
/// that a rail exists — which is why `map_screen.dart` needed no changes at all
/// for its D-pad and legend to lift above it.

/// One island holding both rows: what you can do about yourself, and where you

///
/// These were two separate floating bars for about an hour, and the hour was
/// instructive. Two rounded rectangles stacked with a gap read as two unrelated
/// widgets that happened to land near each other, and the eye kept asking which
/// one it was supposed to be looking at. Attached, with a hairline between them,
/// they read as one control surface with a section that comes and goes — which is
/// what they are.
///
/// ## Why the whole dock is one width
///
/// [IntrinsicWidth] over a stretched column: the column takes the width of its
/// widest row, and every other row is stretched to match. So the navigation is
/// exactly as wide as the controls above it, its three destinations dividing
/// that width between them as equal segments. Left to themselves the two rows
/// would be different widths and the join would have a visible step in it.
///
/// The widest row is usually neither of them: [kRailMinWidth] puts a floor
/// under the island. Without it the nav row alone measured 180 points — a pill
/// lost at the bottom of the screen — and the island lurched sideways every
/// time the control row came or went. With it, both rows spread across the same
/// steady width, and only a control row that genuinely outgrows the floor (the
/// camera flip and the leave door together) widens the island past it.
///
/// ## Why it grows and shrinks rather than sliding
///
/// The controls belong to the office, and the first version slid them down behind
/// the rail on the way out. Attached, there is nothing to slide behind: the honest
/// motion for a section of one object leaving is for the object to close up over
/// it. [AnimatedSize] anchored at the bottom does that, so the dock settles onto
/// the navigation row and lifts back off it. Same for the reaction tray, which is
/// a third row and pushes the dock upwards rather than floating over it.
///
/// The controls cannot live *inside* the map tab, which is where they belong
/// conceptually: an `IndexedStack` stops painting a tab the moment it is not
/// selected, so a row animating out from in there would be switched off
/// mid-gesture rather than seen to leave.
