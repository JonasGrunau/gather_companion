/// The faces. Everybody the SFU is sending us, plus your own tile — always
/// present, your camera when it is on and an avatar when it is not.
///
/// ## Why this is a route and not a panel
///
/// Video wants the screen. The map answers "where is everyone", the control bar
/// answers "what am I doing", and neither has room for a person's face at a size
/// worth looking at. Pushing a route also means the renderers exist only while
/// somebody is looking at them, which is the whole ballgame for battery: an
/// `RTCVideoRenderer` that is off-screen still decodes.
///
/// ## The renderer lifecycle is the thing to get right
///
/// `RTCVideoRenderer` is a native texture with a manual lifecycle: `initialize()`
/// before use, `dispose()` after, and `srcObject = null` *before* the stream
/// underneath it goes away. Get the order wrong and you get a black rectangle
/// that never recovers, or a crash in the platform view when a track is stopped
/// while still attached. That is why [_VideoTile] is a `StatefulWidget` holding
/// exactly one renderer, keyed by participant, and why the key matters: a reused
/// element pointed at a different stream would show the last person's frame.
///
/// ## The test seam
///
/// `RTCVideoRenderer.initialize()` needs a `MethodChannel`, which does not exist
/// under `flutter test`. [CallScreen.buildTile] lets a widget test swap the video
/// surface for something inert and assert on layout, naming and the empty states
/// — everything except the pixels, which are the platform's job anyway.
