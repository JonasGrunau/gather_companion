///
/// This used to hold a `BridgeClient` — a WebSocket to a computer on the same wifi,
/// with sequence-based catch-up, ping-driven liveness and a generation counter to
/// stop overlapping resumes from orphaning sockets. All of that existed because the
/// phone could not talk to Gather.
///
/// It can. So the socket is now to Gather itself, and the bridge is left with two
/// jobs: handing over the credential at pairing, and pushing when this app is not
/// running. Three consequences worth knowing:
///
///  * **The computer can be asleep.** Presence works on cellular, from anywhere.
///  * **Party mode is instant.** It runs here, against a socket we already hold, so
///    the optimistic-UI dance that hid a LAN round trip is gone entirely.
///  * **Nothing is remembered.** There is no 500-event ring on the bridge to
///    replay, and the phone does not keep one either: a log that can only record
///    what happened while the app was open is empty exactly when it would be worth
///    reading. Events exist to be notified about. `_onFold` hands each one to
///    [Notifier] and lets it go.
