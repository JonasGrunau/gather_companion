/// `debugPrint` is the obvious sink and it is not enough here. In a profile or
/// release build Flutter routes `print` through the engine's logging callback
/// into `os_log`, not the process's stdout — so `devicectl … --console`, which
/// bridges stdout and stderr, shows every `NSLog` the WebRTC plugin makes and
/// not one line of Dart. That was not a detail: it cost a whole debugging round
/// on 2026-09-17, where the only evidence of a call was the camera's native
/// format line and the app's own account of what it did was invisible.
///
/// So every line also goes to a file. `Directory.systemTemp` on iOS is the app
/// sandbox's `tmp/`, which means no `path_provider` dependency and a path that
/// `devicectl` can reach:
///
/// ```sh
/// xcrun devicectl device copy from --device <udid> \
///   --domain-type appDataContainer --domain-identifier com.jonasgrunau.gatherCompanion \
///   --source tmp/media.log --destination ./media.log
/// # …and tmp/media.log.1 for the prior rotated segment.
/// ```
///
/// Appended across launches, not truncated, because the incident worth reading
/// is usually on the run *before* the one that noticed it: a socket that quietly
/// stopped being present, a reconnect that never landed. Truncating on launch
/// wiped exactly that evidence every time the app was relaunched to "try again".
/// Each run is fenced by a `=== launch … ===` banner so the eye finds its start.
///
/// Growth is bounded by rotation, not by forgetting: when the live file passes
/// [_maxLogBytes] it is rolled to `media.log.1` (the previous `.1` dropped), so
/// at most two segments survive — the current run and roughly one run before it.
/// Nothing here is durable: iOS may purge `tmp/` under storage pressure and wipes
/// it on uninstall.
///
/// It is opened lazily and written synchronously: this is a diagnostic, and a
/// diagnostic that loses the last few lines to a buffer is worthless precisely
/// when it matters — the lines just before a hang are the ones being looked for.
/// A buffered [IOSink] would not give that: its `writeln` returns before the
/// bytes reach the OS and an abrupt kill drops whatever is still queued, so the
/// tail — the part being hunted — is the first thing lost. A [RandomAccessFile]
/// with `flushSync` after every line is what makes the tail survive.
