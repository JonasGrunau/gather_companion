/// The one file in the app that touches WebRTC.
///
/// Everything else talks to [MediaEngine]. Keeping the plugin import in a single
/// place is what lets `AppState` and the call logic be tested on a machine with
/// no camera, and it is the same discipline `DirectCollector`'s connect-seam
/// follows for the socket.
///
/// ## What `flutter_webrtc` is left to do
///
/// Audio session management is **not** hand-configured here. Since 1.5.0 the
/// Darwin implementation runs on AVAudioEngine with Apple's platform voice
/// processing — acoustic echo cancellation, noise suppression, automatic gain —
/// and that is materially better than anything worth writing by hand. Taking it
/// over is an option the plugin offers and a decision this app has no reason to
/// make.
///
/// Output *routing* is the one exception, and it is a different thing. Left to
/// the plugin defaults, remote audio comes out of the earpiece — right for a
/// phone held to the ear, wrong for a companion app set down on a desk, where you
/// then hear nobody. So [prepareAudioSession] sets the loudspeaker as the default
/// (and auto-selects a headset when one is in), through the plugin's own
/// `setAppleAudioIOMode` / `setAndroidAudioConfiguration` / `setSpeakerphoneOn`.
/// Those set category, mode and route; they do **not** switch off the voice
/// processing above, so the two stances do not contradict.
///
/// Mute happens at the **audio device**, not on the track, and the platform mute
/// sound is accepted rather than avoided.
///
/// `track.enabled = false` is the obvious alternative and the wrong one here. It
/// stops the frames while the capture session keeps running, which means iOS
/// keeps its orange microphone indicator lit for the whole time you are muted —
/// and somebody watching that dot will reasonably conclude they are still being
/// listened to. Being quietly wrong about whether a microphone is live is not a
/// thing this app should do.
///
/// So mute goes through `Helper.setMicrophoneMuted`, in
/// [MicrophoneMuteMode.voiceProcessing]. That mode plays the platform's
/// mute/unmute sound on every toggle. That is Apple's deliberate affordance, not
/// a defect, and it comes with the thing that makes it worth having: **muted
/// talker detection**, the system noticing when you are speaking while muted.
/// Every call app eventually grows a "you're on mute" tap on the shoulder; this
/// one gets it from the platform.
///
/// The two silent modes exist and are the trade to make if the sound ever becomes
/// the complaint: [MicrophoneMuteMode.inputMixer] is fast and silent but keeps the
/// session running, and [MicrophoneMuteMode.restartEngine] is silent and actually
/// stops capture, at the price of a slower unmute.
///
/// Because the device switch is **global rather than per-track**, the state below
/// is read back with `isMicrophoneMuted()` after every change rather than
/// assumed. Assuming would let the UI and the hardware drift apart, and the
/// direction that drift goes — showing "muted" while live — is the bad one.
///
/// **Unverified on hardware.** The justification above rests on iOS treating a
/// voice-processing mute as "not recording" and dropping the orange indicator,
/// which is the behaviour the API exists to provide. It has not been watched on a
/// real device yet. If the dot stays lit while muted, the reasoning for choosing
/// this over `track.enabled` collapses and the choice should be revisited rather
/// than kept for its own sake.
