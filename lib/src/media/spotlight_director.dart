/// Picks whose face to enlarge in automatic mode, from who is talking.
///
/// The call screen's spotlight can follow the active speaker, and the one thing
/// that must not happen is for it to jump — a cough, a one-word "yeah", a scrape
/// of a chair all light the speaking ring for a moment, and a big view that
/// chased every one of them would be unwatchable. So promotion is gated two ways,
/// the same shape as [VoiceActivity] one level down:
///
///  * **Dwell.** A new speaker has to hold the floor for [dwell] before the view
///    moves to them. Shorter than that and they never become the target.
///  * **Sticky.** Once somebody is the target, they keep it for as long as they
///    keep talking. A second person talking over them does not steal it; the view
///    moves only once the current speaker actually stops and somebody else has
///    held the floor for the dwell. That is what turns "loudest wins, moment to
///    moment" into "the person with the floor", which is what a meeting actually
///    looks like.
///
/// And once the view is on somebody, it *stays* big across the gaps. A finished
/// turn does not drop back to the grid — the last speaker lingers, enlarged, and
/// the next speaker to hold the floor takes the big view over directly, so a
/// handoff is one face replacing another rather than a flash of the overview
/// between them. Only a real lull — nobody talking at all for [linger] — falls
/// back to the grid.
///
/// Pure on purpose, exactly like [VoiceActivity]: no timers, no clock of its own.
/// It is handed the set of people speaking and the time, and it answers who to
/// show. The call screen owns the one timer that re-asks when a dwell — or a
/// [linger] — elapses.
///
/// Self is never in the set it is handed — you do not get enlarged on your own
/// screen for talking — so that rule lives in the caller, not here.
